Today in our… I'd say adequate town of Huckerston, nothing of interest really happened, but what are we doing here at B.N.S. if not covering every excruciating detail of how absolutely nothing happened in town today. But first, before I really start getting into things, let me take very long sip from my cup of lukewarm water. <sipping water> Ah. That's the stuff. <sips more water> Thanks for accompanying me in that exciting journey of sipping lukewarm water from my big ol' thermos. I'm going to take one last sip of water now. <sips water deliciously> For those of you just tuning in, this is the Boring News Station and I'm your host, Ben Boring. Now, where was I? Oh that's right………… I was about to inform every one of you painfully average people about the uninteresting events that occurred in our town today. Let's start with my own home. There was a bird outside of my house this morning. It was standing in the bird bath, but there was no water in the bird bath. Therefore, the bird was not having a bath, and was getting absolutely nothing accomplished. I believe the bird was a sparrow, but I have been wrong several times before. It could be a pigeon, but I don't think pigeons live around Huckerston very commonly. It may have not been a bird at all. Now that I think about it, it was definitely not a real bird. It's one of those fake birds that are built into bird baths in order to attract other birds to the bird bath. ",
